Homework for the seventh lesson

**task1** we created a class "CreditCard" with the fields "Account number" and "Current amount".  
Created one constructor with two parameters. Created methods for increasing and decreasing the amount,  
outputting information to the console. Created class "Main" to test the methods of the "CreditCard" class.

**task2** we created a class to describe the students of our group (Student).  
Class fields: name, surname, passport number, group name.  
We created objects of this class in the new "Main" class for each of the students in our group.  
We placed all these objects in an array.  
We went through the array with a for-each loop and output the information to the console.
